			<p>a floating tree house </p>
			<p>filled with other kids having adventures.</p>
			<p>I saw so many wonderful things.</p>

					<h1>READ</h1>
					<p>READ started out as a mimic assignment in an advanced creative non-fiction workshop in Spring 2012. It has since helped me answer when anyone asks me why I bother reading those old paper backs over and over again.</p>

					<h1>Super</h1>
					<p>If you could have any super power in the world, what would it be? I spent a while thinking about the power of imagination and what would happen if I had a character who could make anything happen. A character who was only limited by their own imagination. What challenges could possibly stand in their way? What would I do with such a power?
"Super" started out as an assignment for an introductory Creative Writing course in the summer of 2011, and has turned into a fun exercise in the power of imagination. What do you think will happen next?</p>
